This is breifly what I did and utilized with this project!

- Used Express.js to create a Node.js web server.

- Set up GET routes to serve selective JSON data based on parameters (req.param and req.query).

- Used Heroku to deploy the server ( You can visit it at the website link above )

- Created POST routes to allow my server to accept incoming data and tested it with Insomnia.

- Used middleware in Express.js.

- Updated my server to serve client-side code for users to interface with.

- Revisited the Fetch API to make requests to my server.

- Modularized and scaled my API by using the Express.js Router.

- Tested my application using Jest and helped make it predictable as you scaled up.
